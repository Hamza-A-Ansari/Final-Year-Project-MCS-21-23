Requirement specifications
	Existing System:
	As technology progresses, the need for artificial intelligence grows. Various
	studies in different areas are being done for the integration of artificial 
	intelligence, resulting in AI evolving at a rapid pace.
	Customers may utilize apps that allow them to enter their height, weight,
	and body shape to generate a digital avatar that can be used to try on
	clothes digitally. Although the digital avatar is not the same as the user, app
	developers may create an interface that uses the device’s live camera feed to
	scan the user’s body and put digital outfit on their person. The end result
	would be a highly exact and precise fitting room experience that you could
	have from the comfort of your own home.

	Proposed System:
	Our Hybrid web and app will be designed for devices that meet all of the standards for artificial intelligence. The software will be free to download and use, and everything will be unlocked. Our application has many features the first main feature is virtual try-on with the help of artificial intelligence, here let's take the example of glasses with the help of this feature users can able to adjust glasses model on their face by using a webcam or mobile camera, all the outfit standard size measurements that a normal user would want for choosing the perfect size outfit while online/onsite shopping at outfit brand stores like Outfitters, Furor, etc. The other main feature is the chatbot in the hybrid system, this makes the application user-friendly it will give suggestions to the user on their shopping. As we have said, modern customers prefer sending messages to businesses rather than making phone calls. But, to keep customers engaged with your business, you need to respond in time. In fact, according to Har		vard Business Review research, a five-minute delay in answering a customer query decreases the customer engagement rate. By providing customers with immediate responses, shopping chatbots significantly drive sales to an online store. When customers are visiting an online store to buy a particular pair of jeans, they spend some time in the product catalog to find the exact pair they are searching for. Such a buying process may become an irritating experience, especially if an online store has numerous product categories. To avoid this, we integrate chatbots to help buyers in selecting products that perfectly meet their needs.
